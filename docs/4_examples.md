# Examples

## Programmatic Examples

A series of notebooks demonstrates how to load and use the pretrained models for property predictions and structural descriptors extraction.

1. [Property Prediction](https://github.com/jcwang587/cgcnn2/blob/main/examples/p01_property_prediction.ipynb)
2. [Structural Descriptor](https://github.com/jcwang587/cgcnn2/blob/main/examples/p02_structural_descriptor.ipynb)

## Command Line Examples

The following Slurm scripts are examples of how to run the training, prediction, and fine-tuning of the models.

1. [Train a CGCNN from scratch](https://github.com/jcwang587/cgcnn2/blob/main/examples/s01_slurm_train.sh)
2. [Make predictions using a pre-trained model](https://github.com/jcwang587/cgcnn2/blob/main/examples/s02_slurm_predict.sh)
3. [Fine-tune a pre-trained model](https://github.com/jcwang587/cgcnn2/blob/main/examples/s03_slurm_fine_tuning.sh)
